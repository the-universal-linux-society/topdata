# TOPDATA
Script built on the 'TOP' system monitor utility, to give you data of your CPU, Memory and Disks.

This script is lighweight, and unlike TOP that gives you the information in realtime, this script gives you a screenshot of the data at the point of executing the script. 

### USAGE:

> clone the repo

> chmod +x topdata.sh

> ./topdata.sh
